# N3N3 
N3N3 is a program developed as an assignment of CS112 course at Cairo University Faculty of Computers and Artificial Intelligence by Mohammed Hany, Ahmed Samir, and Loay Medhat supervised by Dr Mohamed El-Ramely. Utilizing the class developed by the professor's team, we devised 20 image processing filters to do basic image manipulation processes such as crop or lighten, as well as other advanced processes like edge detection, merge, and oil painting.

# Features
* **20 Different Filters:** The application offers a variety of filters to modify and enhance images, providing users with a range of options for image manipulation: Grayscale, Black and White, Invert, Merge, Flip, Rotate, Darken and Enlighten, Crop, Adding a Frame, Detect Edges, Sunlight, Blur, Resize, Oil Painting, Den Den Moshi TV, Purplizer, Infrared, Skewing, Color Balancer, and Glitch.

* **User-Friendly Interface:** Built using Qt, the application provides an intuitive and user-friendly interface for easy navigation and filter selection (Using sliders, buttons, spinbox, etc).

* **Easy Integration:** Developers can easily integrate the provided filters into their own projects by moving three specific files into their Qt project folder (Prefferable to be Windows x64 bits system).

# Getting Started
**1. Clone the repository:** Clone this repository to your local machine using Git:
```
git clone https://github.com/Ahmed-Samir11/N3N3.git
```

**2. Move Files to Qt Project Folder:** To integrate the filters into your own Qt project, move the following files into your project folder:
* main.cpp
* mainwindow.h
* mainwindow.ui
  
**3. Build and Run:** Build and run your Qt project to start using N3N3 program.
