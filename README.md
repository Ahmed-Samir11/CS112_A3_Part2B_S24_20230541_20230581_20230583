# N3N3 
N3N3 is a program developed as an assignment of CS112 course at Cairo University Faculty of Computers and Artificial Intelligence by Mohammed Hany, Ahmed Samir, and Loay Medhat supervised by Dr Mohamed El-Ramely. Utilizing the class developed by the professor's team, we devised 20 image processing filters to do basic image manipulation processes such as crop or lighten, as well as other advanced processes like edge detection, merge, and oil painting. 
Further, the program has a great and user friendly GUI that took a lot of Mohammed's time to finish. I worked with Loay on the remaining tasks collaboratively until we got satisfying results.
